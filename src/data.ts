      "The PRP Facial treatment is an innovative and non-invasive procedure that uses Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy to improve overall skin texture, enhance elasticity, and promote a youthful-looking complexion. During the treatment, a small sample of the patient's blood is taken and spun in a centrifuge to separate the PRP from the red blood cells. This PRP is topically applied after a microdermabrasion procedure which has been enhanced with PRP to stimulate collagen and elastin production. The combination of microdermabrasion and PRP helps to resurface the skin and remove dead skin cells while promoting rejuvenation and repair, leaving the skin plumper and tighter looking with improved clarity. The results of the PRP Facial can be seen as a gradual improvement to skin texture and brightness that can last from any where from 6 months up to 2 years. Overall, the PRP Facial is a safe and effective way to naturally revitalize the skin by tapping into the power of the patient's own blood platelets, and it's suitable for people with different skin types or conditions.",
